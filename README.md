### Key Points: 

- Winter soil nutrient availability matched the growing season, with potential transport from soils in forested and agricultural catchments. 

- Mixing analysis showed complex winter soil–stream connectivity that differed between forested and agricultural catchments. 

- Winter in Vermont is far more dynamic and relevant to annual nutrient budgets than previously considered.
