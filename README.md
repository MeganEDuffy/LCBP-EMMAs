### Key Points: 

- Winter soil nutrient availability matched the growing season, with potential transport from soils in forested and agricultural catchments. 

- Mixing analysis showed complex winter soil–stream connectivity that differed between forested and agricultural catchments. 

- Winter in Vermont is far more dynamic and relevant to annual nutrient budgets than previously considered.

### Abstract 

More frequent and intense rain-on-snow events and mid-winter thermal thaws, as well as thinner and inconsistent snowpack have been observed in the northeastern USA. Yet the impact of changing winter conditions on flowpaths and consequences to nutrient cycles and budgets is unknown. To manage and predict water quality, it is critical to understand how warming winters mobilize water and nutrients. Here, we used three complementary  approaches to investigate hydrologic connectivity and nutrient mobilization during  winter runoff events: in situ stream  nutrient data,  soil nutrient availability, and event-level end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) to determine  source contributions to streamflow during three separate mid-winter to spring melt events at two low-order streams – one forested, one agricultural in  Vermont, USA. We found that soil available nitrate, phosphate, and ammonium were present throughout the winter for transport.  EMMA identified three end-member sources to streamflow: groundwater, meltwater, and soil water. The agricultural catchment, where soils remained subfreezing all winter, displayed consistent temporal flowpath dynamics for all runoff events, with pre-event groundwater successively replaced by meltwater, then soil water. In contrast, the forested catchment with consistent snowpack and above-freezing soils displayed a seasonal progression, from no apparent soil-stream connectivity during a February rain-on-snow event to increasing contributions of soil water to streamflow during a March thermal event and the spring melt. These analyses suggest that winter in this climate is far more dynamic and relevant to nutrient budgets than previously considered, and that landcover and snowpack behavior modulate soil/snow-stream connectivity and nutrient provenance during winter thaws. 

### Plain Language Summary 

Changes in how water moves through a landscape can affect the timing, amount, and quality of water entering streams during snowmelt, yet we do not fully understand how changing winter conditions influence runoff pathways. Winters are expected to include more rain-on-snow events, mid-winter thaws, and thinner snowpacks. These changes may affect whether water falls as snow or rain and its ability to infiltrate soils or move across the surface, potentially altering connections between soils and streams. Understanding winter water and nutrient movement is important for managing land and water resources. We analyzed how meltwater, soil water, and groundwater contribute to streamflow during three snowmelt events from mid-winter to spring in two streams in Vermont, agricultural and forested. Soil nutrients were available for transport at both sites. Across events, streamwater could be explained as a mixture of groundwater, meltwater, and soil water. In the agricultural catchment, where soils remained frozen, flowpaths were consistent across events, with groundwater replaced by meltwater and then soil water. In contrast, the forested catchment showed a seasonal shift from little soil-stream connectivity to increasing soil water contributions. This suggests winter runoff models must account for land use, soil conditions, and snowpack evolution to predict water quality.
